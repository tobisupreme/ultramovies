        <div class="meta-description">For best friends Becky and Hunter, life is all about conquering fears and pushing
          limits. But after they climb 2,000 feet to the top of a remote, abandoned radio tower, they find themselves
          stranded with no way down. Now Becky and Hunter's expert climbing skills will be put to the ultimate test as
          they desperately fight to survive the elements, a lack of supplies, and vertigo-inducing heights.</div>
